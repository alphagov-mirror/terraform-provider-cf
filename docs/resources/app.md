# cloudfoundry_app

Provides a Cloud Foundry [application](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/deploy-apps/deploy-app.html) resource.

## Example Usage

The following example creates an application. The created application is
stopped and it does not stage or deploy your application source.

To build your application droplet and have it deployed to your application
see the `cloudfoundry_droplet` and `cloudfoundry_deployment`
resources.

```hcl
resource "cloudfoundry_app" "basic" {
	provider              = cloudfoundry-v3
	name                  = "basic-buildpack"
	space_id              = data.cloudfoundry_space.myspace.id
	environment           = {MY_VAR = "1"}
	instances             = 2
	memory_in_mb          = 1024
	disk_in_mb            = 1024
	health_check_type     = "http"
	health_check_endpoint = "/"
}
```
